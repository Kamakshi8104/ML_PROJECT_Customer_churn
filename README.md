# Customer Churn Analysis using PCA + Clustering, XGBoost, and ANN

## üìå Abstract
Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based businesses. This project explores three distinct approaches for churn analysis:  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by Clustering**  
- **XGBoost Classification**  
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**

By leveraging these techniques, the project aims to:
- Segment customers  
- Predict churn likelihood  
- Identify key churn-driving factors

These insights help companies implement **data-driven retention strategies**, reduce attrition, and improve customer loyalty.
